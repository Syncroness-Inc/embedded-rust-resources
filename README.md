# Embedded Rust Resources
A short list of resources that are useful when learning rust for embedded.

- [Rust Embedded Discovery](https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/) - Documentation automated for environment setup. Awesome projects to try and implement yourself to become a master rustacean.

- [Microrust](https://droogmic.github.io/microrust/appendix/troubleshooting.html) - Another beginner friendly book with helpful troubleshooting steps with GDB and openGCD.

- [The Embedded Rust Book](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/) - Assumes expierence with embedded systems and Rust. Good resource for interoperability between Rust and C.

- [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/) - Discusses unsafe rust. Particaulary useful charpters are `Data Layout` and `Beneath std`.

- [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) - Great resource for how to create different builds.

- [Writing udev rules](http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html) - The ins and outs of udev rules.

- [awesome-embedded-rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust) - A curated and maintained list of embedded rust resources. Great place to periodically check for new developments and off the shelf solutions.
